# fhir-rdf-validation
This repository contains information and files from work to validate FHIR RDF resources.

We documented and followed a consistent process to validate instances of the HL7 FHIR RDF Provenance and Observation resources. 

The steps of this technical process are below. 

Technical Steps to Validate HL7 FHIR RDF Resources
Clone ShEx.js from its GitHub repository and Install ShEx.js
Initiate the ShEx.js server
Load the ShEx.js server with HL7 FHIR RDF Shape Expression Schemas35 with the needed resource validation constraints
Load a text file with the HL7 FHIR RDF Resource to be validated in TTL format
Validate the Resource via an API call to the ShEx server
